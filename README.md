# Data Standards Training Template

Training-orientated repository for developing and publishing a modular, consensus-based ontology data specification for pathogen surveillance.

This directory houses all training content built around the Data Specification Development Process.

- `workshop/` – materials for live and asynchronous courses (e.g., FSCI, PHA4GECon).  
- `scenarios/` – reusable, themed datasets and schemas for exercises.  

Each workshop draws from the same core resources in the main repository (`process/`, `resources/`, `Reference Guide/`).

This resource has been developed by Charlotte Barclay, Emma Griffiths and Rhiannon Cameron and was first implemented in the [GRDI contextual data specification](https://github.com/cidgoh/GRDI\_AMR\_One\_Health).
