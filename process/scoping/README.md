# Scoping a data specification

In this directory you'll find links to resources and instructions for the **scoping** phase of a data specification development.

Different specifications address different data needs, but not all projects require creating a new specification. Some specifications can  be updated to ensure they are fit-for-purpose, while other situations require a new standard. 

Before reinventing the wheel, it is worth seeing what standards already exist. Good resources for finding and exploring genomics standards include the \[Genomics Standards Consortium](https://www.gensc.org), the \[Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology GitHub organization ](https://github.com/pha4ge), and the list of \[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/docs/attributes) attributes webpage.

## Purpose
To systematically identify the **need** for a new specification and the relevant boundaries, including:
- the use-cases the specification will support
- the key stakeholders
- the boundaries for the specification (what is *in* scope vs *out* of scope)
