# Data Needs Assessment

The purpose of the data needs assessment phase is to gather requirements from both artefacts and people. In this phase, we review existing data structures (standards, case report forms, repository packages and attributes) and extract candidate data elements. We also conduct structured interviews with stakeholders, ensuring representation from the entire data life cycle to identify pain points and priorities for data flow.

This directory contains templates for performing a data needs assessment, one of the foundational steps in developing a data specification. 

## Purpose
To systematically identify:
- **What** data is collected and why
- **Who** collects, processes, and uses it
- **Existing infrastructure** including standards, how (and where) data is stored and data workflows
- **Challenges** gaps, and future needs
