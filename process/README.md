# The specification development process

The process directory describes the key phases and processes required to develop a new contextual data specification. For a detailed overview of the key standard development phases, and the ten steps required to complete them, see the paper :page_facing_up:[10 simple rules for developing a data specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQkX-5iiyZf6sNEw52YZIPmdKW_3eTYCKQRhw8eJxI4/edit?usp=sharing).

There are six key phases when developing your data specification:
  1. **Scoping**
  2. **Data needs assessment and gap analysis**
  3. **Drafting a schema**
  4. **Implementation**
  5. **Testing** (and feedback)
  6. **Maintenance** (a specificcation is only as good as it's uptake, and to encourage use specifications must adapt as needs change).
