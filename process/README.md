# The specification development process

The process directory describes the key phases and processes required to develop a new contextual data specification. For a detailed overview of the key standard development phases, and the ten steps required to complete them, see the paper :page_facing_up:[10 simple rules for developing a data specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQkX-5iiyZf6sNEw52YZIPmdKW_3eTYCKQRhw8eJxI4/edit?usp=sharing).

The resources provided in this repository help teams plan, document, and synthesise contextual data requirements that inform the design of interoperable, ontology-aligned data standards.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview of the Specification Development Process

Developing a robust data specification involves **10 iterative steps**, grouped into **6 major stages**.  
Each stage contributes to defining, building, validating, and maintaining a data standard that is useful, interoperable, and future-proof.

### **ðŸ”¹ 1. Initiation & Scoping**
- Identify the need  
- Define the main goals and scope (including stakeholders)

### **ðŸ”¹ 2. Data Needs Assessment & Gap Analysis**
-  Perform a data needs assessment
-  Identify existing data, gaps, and stakeholder requirements

### **ðŸ”¹ 3. Schema Development (Fields and Terms)**
-  Draft a preliminary schema of fields and terms
-  Define structure, data types, and controlled vocabularies)

### **ðŸ”¹ 4. Implementation in Tooling and Interchange Mappings**
-  Develop interchange mappings  
-  Develop materials to support use of specification  
(Templates, SOPs, LinkML or JSON mappings)

### **ðŸ”¹ 5. Testing and Feedback**
-  Testing (pilot or subgrant implementation)  
-  Finalise schema after feedback

### **ðŸ”¹ 6. Future Proofing (Maintenance and Communication)**
-  Document real-world implementation  
-  Share and communicate (ensure sustainability, accessibility, and community ownership)
