# Phase 2: Environmental Surveillance – A Lead in the Sewers

&#x1F4CD; *March 5, 2025 – Riverdale, Newlandia*

Following the hospital outbreak, epidemiologists suggest environmental monitoring as there has been speculation that other individuals in the community, not just those in the hospital, may be affected by Purple Fever.

A technician collects a wastewater sample (Sample ID: NEW-GR-0054) from the hospital sewage system and submits it for metagenomic sequencing at the Newlandia Genomics Institute (NGI).

At this stage, no specific pathogen is suspected, so broad sequencing is performed.

**Discussion Prompts**

- What are the advantages of environmental surveillance for outbreak response?
- What other contextual data fields are required to adequately monitor environmental samples?
- How can we ensure traceability, considering information that has yet to be known?
- How do we balance specificity vs. broad screening in sequencing?

**Task**

After discussing the points above, decide which additional fields may be required in environmental surveillance. Consider the 'Bioinformatics and QC metrics', 'Taxonomic information' and 'Lineage and Clade information' in existing specifications.
