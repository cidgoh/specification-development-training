# PHA4GECon Workshop – Developing and Implementing Data Standards

## Oveview
This hands-on workshop introduces the end-to-end process of data standard development, from defining scope and needs, to selecting ontology terms, to implementing a working schema. Participants will use an example scenario and curated templates to practice designing structured, interoperable data specifications.

**Purpose:** To guide participants through the principles and practical steps of developing a data standard, following the *10 Simple Rules for Developing a Data Specification*.

**Structure:**  
The workshop builds upon material developed for the FSCI course, incorporating selected exercises in the **morning Part 2** session.  
The remaining sessions follow the *10 Simple Rules* framework, focusing on:
- conducting a **needs assessment** for a mock scenario,  
- a **ebi ols exercise** to identify appropriate ontology terms,
- operationalising a specification through tooling, a **DataHarmonizer** example and
- encouraging **implementation and testing** of the developed specification.


**Audience:** Researchers, data managers, and public health professionals involved in developing or implementing standards for infectious disease response. 
This is intended as a more itnroductory course to the practicalities of developing a consensus-based specification.
**Duration:** One day (interactive lectures + hands-on exercises).

**Folder contents**
- `PHA4GECon agenda.pdf` – outline and timings.  
- `0. slides/` – presentation decks for all the sessions.  
- `1. scope/` – facilitator and participant resources, including exercises for part 1 scoping and needs assessment.  
- `2. cleaning data/` – facilitator and participant resources, including exercises for part 1 cleaning data and drafting a schema.

This workshop bridges theory and practice—participants leave with a structured understanding of how to scope, design, implement, and test a contextual data specification.
