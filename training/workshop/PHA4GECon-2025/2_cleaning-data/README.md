# Session 2 ‚Äì Standardising Your Dataset
*From Dirty Data to Ontology-Aligned Schema*

## Purpose:
This session introduces participants to the practical process of cleaning messy contextual data and mapping it to ontology terms for use in data standards such as the PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 specification.
Participants will work hands-on with a small dataset containing inconsistent field entries, learn to harmonize terminology, and align cleaned values with ontology identifiers using public look-up tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, participants will be able to:

- Identify inconsistencies and ambiguities in real-world data.
- Harmonise and clean categorical field values for interoperability.
- Use ontology lookup services (EBI OLS, OntoBee) to source appropriate ontology terms.
- Apply curated ontology-aligned terms to a data schema.

## Exercise Overview
### Part 1 ‚Äì Prepare Terms for Curation

- Download the `Standardise your dataset.xlsx` from the repository.
- Open the *Original Data* tab in the Excel file.
- You will see a sumber of inconsistencies in the dataset. It is good practise to pull out all the unique values (this has been done for you)
- Got to *Part 1* tab and identify duplicates, typos, inconsistent capitalisation, and unclear values.
- Harmonise and record a clean, single label for each unique concept.

üí° See ‚ÄúTips‚Äù box in instructions for guidance on grouping and conceptual thinking.

### Part 2 ‚Äì Look Up Ontology Matches

- Use the EBI Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) to find ontology terms matching your cleaned labels.
- Record:
    - Ontology name (e.g. ENVO, OBI, UBERON)
    - Ontology ID (e.g. ENVO:00002272)
    - Definition (optional)

If no match exists, note ‚ÄúNew term request needed.‚Äù

### Example Output
| Harmonized Label            | ID            | Definition     | Example Use        |
| --------------------------  | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Not Applicable | GENEPIO:0001619 | A categorical choice recorded when a measurable datum does not apply to a given context. | null value menu |
