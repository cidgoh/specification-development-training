# Phase 1 : Outbreak - A mysterious illness in riverdale

&#x1F4CD; *February 28, 2025 - Riverdale General Hospital, Newlandia*

Doctors at Riverdale General Hospital report a cluster of patients presenting with flu-like symptoms and an unusual temporary purple discoloration of the skin. This illness, nicknamed "Purple Fever," does not match any known diseases.

Public health officials from Newlandia Center for Disease Control (NCDC) step in to investigate. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs are collected from five hospitalized patients, but PCR panels for known respiratory viruses return negative results.

With no obvious pathogen detected, the clinical and epidemiological teams raise concerns that this could be a novel infectious agent. They notify the Ministry of Health, and discussions begin about environmental surveillance to track potential sources.

**Discussion Prompts**

- What type of contextual data should be captured when a pathogen is unknown? How should this be structured?
- Are there existing data specifications for similar pathogens that could be used as a starting point?
- From the information provided, what fields are essential for tracking this potential outbreak?
- How can we ensure interoperability of clinical and epidemiological data?

**Task**

After discussing the points above, decide what are the minimum required and recommended fields to capture data for this mysterious outbreak. Consider using existing resources as a guide.

Pick two fields and use EBI OLS to look up appropriate enums for this.
