# Training Scenarios

Reusable, domain-specific scenarios that underpin exercises and workshops.

- **Riverdale/** – an emerging pathogen  surveillance scenario that combines clinical requirenments and environmental surveillance.
- **COVID/** – a clinical sequencing scenario for pathogen data capture and ontology mapping.

Each scenario includes:
- `data/` – small raw and cleaned datasets.
- `schema.xlsx` – minimal schema aligned to the standard.

These scenarios are referenced by workshops but can also be used independently for practice or testing.
