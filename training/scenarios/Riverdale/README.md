# Riverdale Scenario – Emerging Pathogen Response

**Overview:**  
The Riverdale scenario is a phased, “real-time” simulation that walks participants through the stages of developing a contextual data specification during the emergence of a novel pathogen — *Griffithsi E* (Purple Fever).

Each phase represents a step in the outbreak investigation and specification-building process:

1. **Phase 1 – Outbreak:** identifying an unknown illness and defining minimal clinical data fields.  
2. **Phase 2 – Environmental Surveillance:** expanding to wastewater sampling and sequencing.  
3. **Phase 3 – Identification:** adapting the schema once the pathogen is characterized.

**Learning outcomes**
- Understand how data needs evolve as new evidence emerges.  
- Practice defining, curating, and structuring contextual data for clinical and environmental samples.  
- Map fields to ontology terms and test schema updates across phases.  

**How to use this scenario**
- Run it sequentially within a workshop (e.g., FSCI or PHA4GECon).  
- After each phase, update the schema under `schema/` to reflect new requirements.  
- Discuss the provided prompts and complete the tasks as a group or individually.
