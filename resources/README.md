# Resources

## Overview
This folder contains folders cand links to resources that support developing data specification. In this section you can find:
- **publications**: a subfolder containing existing publications and preprints relating to the specification development process as well as publications of our standards
- **reference guide**: a subfolder containing master reference guide materials, a complete list of the current fields and terms in PHA4GE/CIDGOH specifications
- **templates**: a subfolder containing templates for different stages in the data specification development processes 

These materials provide the scientific and procedural background underpinning the training modules and reference guides in this repository.

## Purpose
The goal of this section is to provide resources that you can assess and re-use in your specification development process. All our CIDGOH and PHA4GE data specification repositories are available online. The most popular include:
- [The GRDI One Health contextual data repository](https://github.com/cidgoh/GRDI_AMR_One_Health)
- [The PHA4GE Wastewater contextual data repository](https://github.com/pha4ge/Wastewater_Contextual_Data_Specification/tree/main)
- [The CanCOGeN contextual data repository](https://github.com/cidgoh/CanCOGeN_Contextual_Data_Specification)
- [The PHA4GE minimal contextual data repository](https://github.com/pha4ge/minimal-pathogen-agnostic-contextual-data-specification)
