# Reference Guides

Every specification should have a reference guide. This encourages uptake and minimises misuse. This folder contains a "Master Reference Guide" that lists all fields and picklists currently used acrossed PHA4GE and associated [CIDGOH](https://github.com/cidgoh) specifications. Only one instance of each field/menu is listed and does not reflect all possible user interface labels. These resources are for training purposes only.

For an example of an individual specification guide, see the PHA4GE Wasterwater Specification: https://github.com/pha4ge/Wastewater_Contextual_Data_Specification/tree/main/Reference%20Guide

### Files

- `PHA4GEcon Master Reference Guide (2025-10-20).xlsx` - An excel spreadsheet showing all fields (i.e., slots) and picklists (i.e., enums).
- `PHA4GEcon Master Reference Guide - Fields (2025-10-20).tsv` - A file that lists all fields (i.e., slots) organized by "module" in "module" alphabetical order, which is not normally how modules are presented in a specification reference guide ([example](https://github.com/pha4ge/Wastewater_Contextual_Data_Specification/tree/main/Reference%20Guide)).
- `PHA4GEcon Master Reference Guide - Picklists (2025-10-20).tsv` - A file that lists all picklist (i.e., enums) menus in no particular order. If you are looking for a particular menu it is recommended to use "control/cmd + f" after identifying the menu name in the fields list.
